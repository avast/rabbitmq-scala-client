# RabbitMQ client [![CI](https://github.com/avast/rabbitmq-scala-client/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avast/rabbitmq-scala-client/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Version](https://badgen.net/maven/v/maven-central/com.avast.clients.rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client-api_2.13)](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/avast/clients/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client-api_2.13/)

This client is Scala wrapper over the standard [RabbitMQ Java client](https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-client.html). Goal of this library is
to simplify basic use cases - to provide FP-oriented API for programmers and to shadow the programmer from an underlying client.

The library is configurable both by case classes (`core` module) and by HOCON/Lightbend `Config` (`pureconfig` module).

The library uses concept of _connection_ and derived _producers_ and _consumers_. Note that the _connection_ shadows you from the underlying
concept of AMQP connection and derived channels - it handles channels automatically according to best practises. Each _producer_ and _consumer_
can be closed separately while closing _connection_ causes closing all derived channels and all _producers_ and _consumers_.

## Dependency

`"com.avast.clients.rabbitmq" %% "rabbitmq-client-core" % "x.x.x"`

Gradle:
`compile 'com.avast.clients.rabbitmq:rabbitmq-client-core_$scalaVersion:x.x.x'`

## Migration

There is a [migration guide](Migration-5-6.md) between versions 5 and 6.0.x.  
There is a [migration guide](Migration-6-6_1.md) between versions 6.0.x and 6.1.x.  
There is a [migration guide](Migration-6_1-7.md) between versions 6.1.x and 7.0.x.  
There is a [migration guide](Migration-6_1-8.md) between versions 6.1.x and 8.0.x.

Please note that configuration from Typesafe/Lightbend config has been moved to [pureconfig module](pureconfig) since 8.x.

## Usage

The API is _finally tagless_ (read more e.g. [here](https://www.beyondthelines.net/programming/introduction-to-tagless-final/)) with
[`cats.effect.Resource`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/resource.html) which is convenient way how to
[manage resources in your app](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/tutorial/tutorial.html#acquiring-and-releasing-resources). In addition,
there is a support for [streaming](#streaming-support) with [`fs2.Stream`](https://fs2.io/).

The API uses conversions for both consumer and producer, that means you don't have to work directly with `Bytes` (however you
still can if you want to) and you touch only your business model class which is then (de)serialized using provided converter.

The library uses two types of executors - one is for blocking (IO) operations and the second for callbacks. You _have to_ provide both of them:
1. Blocking executor as `ExecutorService`
1. Callback executor as `scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext`

The default way is to configure the client with manually provided case classes; see [pureconfig](pureconfig) module for a configuration from
HOCON (Lightbend Config).

This is somewhat minimal setup, using [Monix](https://monix.io/) `Task`:

```scala
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService

import cats.effect.Resource
import com.avast.bytes.Bytes
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq._
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.api._
import com.avast.metrics.scalaapi.Monitor
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext
import monix.eval._
import monix.execution.Scheduler

implicit val sch: Scheduler = ???
val monitor: Monitor = ???

val blockingExecutor: ExecutorService = ???

val sslContext = SSLContext.getDefault

val connectionConfig = RabbitMQConnectionConfig(
    hosts = List("localhost:5432"),
    name = "MyProductionConnection",
    virtualHost = "/",
    credentials = CredentialsConfig(username = "vogon", password = "jeltz")
  )

val consumerConfig = ConsumerConfig(
    name = "MyConsumer",
    queueName = "QueueWithMyEvents",
    bindings = List(
      AutoBindQueueConfig(exchange = AutoBindExchangeConfig(name = "OtherAppExchange"), routingKeys = List("TheEvent"))
    )
  )

val producerConfig = ProducerConfig(
    name = "MyProducer",
    exchange = "MyGreatApp"
  )

// see https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/tutorial/tutorial.html#acquiring-and-releasing-resources

val rabbitMQProducer: Resource[Task, RabbitMQProducer[Task, Bytes]] = {
    for {
      connection <- RabbitMQConnection.make[Task](connectionConfig, blockingExecutor, Some(sslContext))
      /*
      Here you have created the connection; it's shared for all producers/consumers amongst one RabbitMQ server - they will share a single
      TCP connection but have separated channels.
      If you expect very high load, you can use separate connections for each producer/consumer, however it's usually not needed.
      */

      consumer <- connection.newConsumer[Bytes](consumerConfig, monitor) {
        case delivery: Delivery.Ok[Bytes] =>
          Task.now(DeliveryResult.Ack)

        case _: Delivery.MalformedContent =>
          Task.now(DeliveryResult.Reject)
      }

      producer <- connection.newProducer[Bytes](producerConfig, monitor)
    } yield {
      producer
    }
  }
```

#### Streaming support

It seems quite natural to process RabbitMQ queue with a streaming app.
[`StreamingRabbitMQConsumer`](core/src/main/scala/com/avast/clients/rabbitmq/StreamingRabbitMQConsumer.scala) provides you an
[`fs2.Stream`](https://fs2.io/) through which you can easily process incoming messages in a streaming way.

Notice: Using this functionality requires you to know some basics of [FS2](https://fs2.io/guide.html#overview) library. Please see it's official
guide if you're not familiar with it first.

```scala
// skipping imports and common things, they are the same as in general example above

val consumerConfig = StreamingConsumerConfig( // notice: StreamingConsumerConfig vs. ConsumerConfig
    name = "MyConsumer",
    queueName = "QueueWithMyEvents",
    bindings = List(
      AutoBindQueueConfig(exchange = AutoBindExchangeConfig(name = "OtherAppExchange"), routingKeys = List("TheEvent"))
    )
  )

val processMyStream: fs2.Pipe[Task, StreamedDelivery[Task, Bytes], StreamedResult] = { in =>
    in.evalMap(delivery => delivery.handle(DeliveryResult.Ack)) // TODO you probably want to do some real stuff here
  }

val deliveryStream: Resource[Task, fs2.Stream[Task, StreamedResult]] = for {
    connection <- RabbitMQConnection.make[Task](connectionConfig, blockingExecutor, Some(sslContext))
    streamingConsumer <- connection.newStreamingConsumer[Bytes](consumerConfig, monitor)
  } yield {
    val stream: fs2.Stream[Task, StreamedResult] = streamingConsumer.deliveryStream.through(processMyStream)
    
    // create resilient (self-restarting) stream; see more information below
    lazy val resilientStream: fs2.Stream[Task, StreamedResult] = stream.handleErrorWith { e =>
      // TODO log the error - something is going wrong!
      resilientStream
    }

    resilientStream
  }
```

While you should never ever let the stream fail (handle all your possible errors; see [Error handling](https://fs2.io/guide.html#error-handling)
section in official docs how the stream can be failed), it's important you're able to recover the stream when it accidentally happens.
You can do that by simply _requesting_ a new stream from the client:

```scala
val stream = streamingConsumer
             .deliveryStream // get stream from client
             .through(processMyStream) // "run" the stream through your processing logic

val resilientStream = stream.handleErrorWith { _ =>  // handle the error in stream: recover by calling itself
  // TODO don't forget to add some logging/metrics here!
  stream
}
```

Please refer to the [official guide](https://fs2.io/guide.html#overview) for understanding more deeply how the recovery of `fs2.Stream` works.

#### Providing converters for producer/consumer

Both the producer and consumer require type argument when creating from _connection_:
1. `connection.newConsumer[MyClass]` which requires implicit `DeliveryConverter[MyClass]`
1. `connection.newProducer[MyClass]` which requires implicit `ProductConverter[MyClass]`

There are multiple options where to get the _converter_ (it's the same case for `DeliveryConverter` as for `ProductConverter`):
1. Implement your own implicit _converter_ for the type
1. Modules [extras-circe](extras-circe/README.md) and [extras-cactus](extras-cactus/README.md) provide support for JSON and GPB conversion. 
1. Use `identity` converter by specifying `Bytes` type argument. No further action needed in that case.

#### Caveats
1. `null` instead of converter instance  
    It may happen you run in this problem:
    ```scala
    scala> import io.circe.generic.auto._
    import io.circe.generic.auto._
    
    scala> import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.extras.format.JsonDeliveryConverter
    import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.extras.format.JsonDeliveryConverter
    
    scala> import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.DeliveryConverter
    import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.DeliveryConverter
    
    scala> case class Event(name: String)
    defined class Event
    
    scala> implicit val deliveryConverter: JsonDeliveryConverter[Event] = JsonDeliveryConverter.derive[Event]()
    deliveryConverter: com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.extras.format.JsonDeliveryConverter[Event] = null
    
    scala> implicit val deliveryConverter: DeliveryConverter[Event] = JsonDeliveryConverter.derive[Event]()
    deliveryConverter: com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.DeliveryConverter[Event] = com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.extras.format.JsonDeliveryConverter$$anon$1@5b977aaa
    
    scala> implicit val deliveryConverter = JsonDeliveryConverter.derive[Event]()
    deliveryConverter: com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.extras.format.JsonDeliveryConverter[Event] = com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.extras.format.JsonDeliveryConverter$$anon$1@4b024fb2
    ```
    Notice the results of last three calls **differ** even though they are supposed to be the same (non-null respectively)! A very similar issue
    is discussed on the [StackOverflow](https://github.com/circe/circe/issues/380) and so is similar the solution:
    1. Remove explicit type completely (not recommended)
    1. Make the explicit type more general (`DeliveryConverter` instead of `JsonDeliveryConverter` in this case)

## Notes

### Extras
There is a module with some optional functionality called [extras](extras/README.md).

### Network recovery
The library offers configurable network recovery, with the functionality itself backed by RabbitMQ client's one (ready in 5+).  
You can either disable the recovery or select (and configure one of following types):
1. Linear  
    The client will wait `initialDelay` for first recovery attempt and if it fails, will try it again each `period` until it succeeds.
1. Exponential  
    The client will wait `initialDelay` for first recovery attempt and if it fails, will try it again until it succeeds and prolong the
    delay between each two attempts exponentially (based on `period`, `factor`, attempt number), up to `maxLength`.  
    Example:  
    For `initialDelay = 3s, period = 2s, factor = 2.0, maxLength = 1 minute`, produced delays will be 3, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 60 seconds
    (and it will never go higher).
    
Do not set too short custom recovery delay intervals (less than 2 seconds) as it is not recommended by the official [RabbitMQ API Guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#automatic-recovery-limitations). 

### DeliveryResult
The consumers `readAction` returns `Future` of [`DeliveryResult`](api/src/main/scala/com/avast/clients/rabbitmq/api/DeliveryResult.scala). The `DeliveryResult` has 4 possible values
(descriptions of usual use-cases):
1. Ack - the message was processed; it will be removed from the queue
1. Reject - the message is corrupted or for some other reason we don't want to see it again; it will be removed from the queue
1. Retry - the message couldn't be processed at this moment (unreachable 3rd party services?); it will be requeued (inserted on the top of
the queue)
1. Republish - the message may be corrupted but we're not sure; it will be re-published to the bottom of the queue (as a new message and the
original one will be removed). It's usually wise  to prevent an infinite republishing of the message - see [Poisoned message handler](extras/README.md#poisoned-message-handler).

#### Difference between _Retry_ and _Republish_
When using _Retry_ the message can effectively cause starvation of other messages in the queue
until the message itself can be processed; on the other hand _Republish_ inserts the message to the original queue as a new message and it
lets the consumer handle other messages (if they can be processed).

#### Republishing
Republishing is solved at application level with publishing a new message (with original content, headers, messageId, etc.) to the original queue and
acknowledging the old one. This can be done via:
1. Default exchange
    Every virtual host in RabbitMQ has default exchange which has implicit bindings to all queues and can be easily used for publishing to
    basically any queue. This is very handy for functionality such as the republishing however it's also very dangerous and you don't have
    permissions to use it. In case you do have them, use this option instead of the custom exchange.  
    This the default option (in other words, the client will use the default exchange in case you don't tell it not to do so).
1. Custom exchange
    In case you're unable to use the default exchange, you have to create your own exchange to replace the functionality. The RabbitMQ client
    will create it for you together with all necessary bindings and all you have to do is to just configure a name of the exchange, e.g.
    ```hocon
       rabbitConnection {
         hosts = ["localhost:5672"]
         virtualHost = "/"
       
         ...
       
         republishStrategy {
           type = CustomExchange
       
           exchangeName = "ExchangeForRepublishing"

           exchangeDeclare = true // default
           exchangeAutoBind = true // default
         }
         
         ...
       }
    ```
   The exchange is created as _direct_, _durable_ and without _auto-delete_ flag.

### Bind/declare arguments
There is an option to specify bind/declare arguments for queues/exchanges as you may read about at [RabbitMQ docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/queues.html).  
Example of configuration with HOCON:
```hocon
  producer {
    name = "Testing" // this is used for logging etc.

    exchange = "myclient"

    // should the producer declare exchange he wants to send to?
    declare {
      enabled = true // disabled by default

      type = "direct" // fanout, topic
      
      arguments = { "x-max-length" : 10000 }
    }
  }

```

### Additional declarations and bindings
Sometimes it's necessary to declare an additional queue or exchange which is not directly related to the consumers or producers you have
in your application (e.g. dead-letter queue).  
The library makes possible to do such thing. Here is example of such configuration with HOCON:
```scala
val rabbitConnection: ConfigRabbitMQConnection[F] = ???

rabbitConnection.bindExchange("backupExchangeBinding") // : F[Unit]
```
where the "backupExchangeBinding" is link to the configuration (use relative path to the `declarations` block in configuration):
```hocon
  declarations {  
    backupExchangeBinding {
      sourceExchangeName = "mainExchange"
      destExchangeName = "backupExchange"
      routingKeys = ["myMessage"]
      arguments {}
    }
  }
```

Equivalent code with using case classes configuration:
```scala
val rabbitConnection: RabbitMQConnection[F] = ???

rabbitConnection.bindExchange(
  BindExchangeConfig(
    sourceExchangeName = "mainExchange",
    destExchangeName = "backupExchange",
    routingKeys = List("myMessage")
  )
) // : F[Unit]
```

### Pull consumer
Sometimes your use-case just doesn't fit the _normal_ consumer scenario. Here you can use the _pull consumer_ which gives you much more
control over the received messages. You _pull_ new message from the queue and acknowledge (reject, ...) it somewhere in the future.

The pull consumer uses `PullResult` as return type:
* Ok - contains `DeliveryWithHandle` instance
* EmptyQueue - there was no message in the queue available

Additionally you can call `.toOption` method on the `PullResult`.

A simplified example, using configuration from HOCON:

```scala
import cats.effect.Resource
import com.avast.bytes.Bytes
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq._
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.pureconfig._
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.api._
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.execution.Scheduler

implicit val sch: Scheduler = ???

val consumer: Resource[Task, RabbitMQPullConsumer[Task, Bytes]] = {
  for {
    connection <- RabbitMQConnection.fromConfig[Task](???, ???)
    consumer <- connection.newPullConsumer[Bytes](??? : String, ???)
  } yield {
    consumer
  }
}

val program: Task[Unit] = consumer.use { consumer =>
  Task
    .sequence { (1 to 100).map(_ => consumer.pull()) } // receive "up to" 100 deliveries
    .flatMap { ds =>
      // do your stuff!

      Task.unit
    }
}
```

### MultiFormatConsumer

Quite often you receive a single type of message but you want to support multiple formats of encoding (Protobuf, Json, ...).
This is where `MultiFormatConsumer` could be used.  

Modules [extras-circe](extras-circe/README.md) and [extras-cactus](extras-cactus/README.md) provide support for JSON and GPB conversion. They
are both used in the example below.

The `MultiFormatConsumer` is Scala only.

Usage example:

[Proto file](core/src/test/proto/ExampleEvents.proto)

```scala
import com.avast.bytes.Bytes
import com.avast.cactus.bytes._ // Cactus support for Bytes, see https://github.com/avast/cactus#bytes
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.test.ExampleEvents.{NewFileSourceAdded => NewFileSourceAddedGpb}
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq._
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.extras.format._
import io.circe.Decoder
import io.circe.generic.auto._ // to auto derive `io.circe.Decoder[A]` with https://circe.github.io/circe/codec.html#fully-automatic-derivation
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.jdk.CollectionConverters._ // <-- for Scala 2.12 use scala.collection.JavaConverters

private implicit val d: Decoder[Bytes] = Decoder.decodeString.map(???)

case class FileSource(fileId: Bytes, source: String)

case class NewFileSourceAdded(fileSources: Seq[FileSource])

val consumer = MultiFormatConsumer.forType[Future, NewFileSourceAdded](
  JsonDeliveryConverter.derive(), // requires implicit `io.circe.Decoder[NewFileSourceAdded]`
  GpbDeliveryConverter[NewFileSourceAddedGpb].derive() // requires implicit `com.avast.cactus.Converter[NewFileSourceAddedGpb, NewFileSourceAdded]`
)(_ => ???)
```
(see [unit test](core/src/test/scala/com/avast/clients/rabbitmq/MultiFormatConsumerTest.scala) for full example)

#### Implementing own `DeliveryConverter`

The [CheckedDeliveryConverter](core/src/main/scala/com/avast/clients/rabbitmq/converters.scala) is usually reacting to Content-Type (like in
the example below) but it's not required - it could e.g. analyze the payload (or first bytes) too. 

```scala
import com.avast.bytes.Bytes
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.CheckedDeliveryConverter
import com.avast.clients.rabbitmq.api.{ConversionException, Delivery}

val StringDeliveryConverter: CheckedDeliveryConverter[String] = new CheckedDeliveryConverter[String] {
  override def canConvert(d: Delivery[Bytes]): Boolean = d.properties.contentType.contains("text/plain")
  override def convert(b: Bytes): Either[ConversionException, String] = Right(b.toStringUtf8)
}
```
